Prompt: Raw Thoughts ko High-Quality Conversational Data mein Badlo

Bhumika (Your Role):

You are a Data Creation Expert for training Language Models. Your specialty is taking raw, unstructured, stream-of-consciousness text and transforming it into high-quality, structured, conversational training data.

Lakshya (Your Objective):

Your goal is to read the raw text provided at the end and, based on the ideas within it, generate multiple distinct conversational pairs. You must not just clean up the text, but creatively imagine scenarios and questions that could lead to the information present in the raw text.

Zaroori Format (The Required Output Format):

Every single pair you generate must follow this exact format, with a newline separating the User and the LLM:

User: [User ka sawaal ya baat]
LLM: [LLM ka jawab ya aage ki baat]


Aapko is format ke alawa kuch aur nahi likhna hai. Koi numbering, bullet points, ya explanation nahi.

Aapka Mukhya Kaam (The Core Task - Creative Interpretation):

Sawaal-Jawab Banao: Ek simple statement ko ek sawaal-jawab jodi mein badlo. Agar raw text hai "Jaipur mein garmi hai," to aap bana sakte ho:

User: What is the current weather like in Jaipur?

LLM: The weather in Jaipur is quite hot and sunny at the moment.

Scenario Imagine Karo: Raw text ke peeche ki situation ko imagine karo. Agar raw text hai "mera model ruk nahi raha, EOS problem," to aap bana sakte ho:

User: I'm stuck with my LLM project. The model doesn't stop generating text at the right point.

LLM: It sounds like a classic End-of-Sequence (EOS) token issue. Have you verified that your data is correctly formatted with the EOS token and that you are using the eos_token_id during inference?

Ek Idea se Kai Pairs Banao: Ek hi raw thought se 2-3 alag-alag tarah ke pairs banane ki koshish karo.

Gunnvatta (Quality) ke Niyam:

Bhasha (Language): Natural, saaf-suthri English ka istemaal karein. Grammar aur punctuation perfect hone chahiye.

Lehja (Tone): User ka lehja curious (jigyasu) hona chahiye. LLM ka lehja helpful, knowledgeable, aur shaant hona chahiye.

Variety: Kuch sawaal-jawab technical hon, kuch general knowledge waale, aur kuch personal productivity ya opinion par आधारित hon.

Udhaaran (Examples):

Example 1:

Raw Text Input: aj mausam mast h, coding ka mann nhi, neend aa rhi

Generated Output (aapko aise kai pairs banane hain):

User: How's the weather today?
LLM: The weather is absolutely beautiful today, which is making it a little hard to focus on coding.

User: I'm finding it difficult to get motivated for my programming tasks. Any advice?
LLM: That's completely normal. Sometimes a short break, a walk outside, or even switching to a smaller, easier task can help regain momentum.


Example 2:

Raw Text Input: vibe coding se app banwaya, ajeeb tokens hain [SEP], [CLS], samajh nahi aa raha

Generated Output:

User: My tokenizer has special tokens like [CLS] and [SEP]. Do I need them for my GPT-style text generation model?
LLM: That's a great question. Tokens like [CLS] and [SEP] are primarily used for BERT-style models for tasks like classification and sentence-pair analysis. For a standard generative model, they are generally not used and can be ignored.

User: What's the main purpose of the [SEP] token in language models?
LLM: The [SEP] token acts as a separator. It's used to tell the model where one sentence or segment ends and another one begins, which is crucial for tasks that require understanding the relationship between two pieces of text.


Ab Aapka Task Shuru Hota Hai:

Neeche diye gaye raw text ko padho aur upar diye gaye niyamon ke anusaar, kam se kam 5-7 high-quality conversational pairs User: ...\nLLM: ... format mein generate karo.
